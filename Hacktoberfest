How to contribute to Hacktoberfest 2022??
Participating in Hacktoberfest is a great way to get involved with the open source community wherever you are on your tech journey.

How can I contribute to Hacktoberfest?

Open source isn't just for developers and people who code. It's for everyone! Hacktoberfest has recently started accepting no-code and low-code contributions, so everyone is included.

You can contribute in various ways, including:

    Making code contributions
    Resolving an issue
    Writing and translating technical documentation
    Introducing a new feature in an existing open source project
    Designing, video production and editing, and graphic design
    Advocacy by podcasts, case studies, blog posts, or social media posts

However, you should know that Hacktoberfest prioritizes quality over quantity.
