# Titanic prediction

## This is a solution to a basic kaggle contest

### The dataset is first preprocessed or cleaned to improve the accuracy of the models

### This model is trained on the train dataset to predict whether a passenger will die due to the sinking of the Titanic ship or not 

Three models are created and their accuracies are checked. The accuracies of the model used are:
* Logistic Regression: 81.16%
* Random Forest Classifier: 78.92%
* K-neighbours classifier: 62.78%
* Support Vector Machine: 80.27%

Since Logistic Regression model shows the highest accuracy, this model was used for prediction.

After training the models on the train dataset, it is tested on the test dataset.
